    <h2>Computer Programming</h2>
    <p>Before getting into computer programming, let us first understand computer programs and what they do.

        A computer program is a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming Language to perform a specified task by the computer.
        
        The two important terms that we have used in the above definition are −
        
        <ul>
            <li>Sequence of instructions</li>
            <li>Computer Programming Language</li>
        </ul>
        </p>
        <p>Computer programming is the act of writing computer programs, which are a sequence of instructions written using a Computer Programming Language to perform a specified task by the computer.

            Computer Programming is fun and easy to learn provided you adopt a proper approach.</p>
            <h3>Introduction to Computers</h3>
            <p>As we mentioned earlier, there are hundreds of programming languages, which can be used to write computer programs and following are a few of them −
            <ul><li>Java</li>
                <li>C</li>
                <li>C++</li>
                <li>Python</li>
                <li>PHP</li>
                <li>Perl</li>
                <li>Ruby</li>
